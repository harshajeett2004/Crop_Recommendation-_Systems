##  Crop Recommendation System using Real-Time Sensor Data

###  Overview

This project presents a **Crop Recommendation System** that utilizes **real-time environmental sensor data** to predict the most suitable crop for cultivation in a given area. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders in making informed crop selection decisions based on **live climate and soil conditions**.

###  Approach

We developed an intelligent system that integrates **machine learning (Random Forest Classifier)** with **real-time sensor inputs** to recommend optimal crops. The model was trained using the **Crop Recommendation Dataset v2** from Kaggle and validated with real-time environmental data collected through our hardware setup.

###  Hardware Components

Our system uses the following sensors to collect real-time environmental data:

* **DHT22**: Measures temperature and humidity
* **Rainfall sensor**: Detects current rainfall levels
* **Soil moisture sensor**: Monitors soil water content
* **pH sensor**: Determines soil acidity or alkalinity

###  Data Pipeline

1. **Historical Dataset**:
   We used the Kaggle [Crop Recommendation Dataset v2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for initial training. This dataset includes parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

2. **Real-Time Sensor Data Collection**:
   Sensor readings are collected via a microcontroller and transmitted to the prediction system.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   Real-time data is cleaned and scaled to match the format of the training dataset.

4. **Model Prediction**:
   A **Random Forest Classifier** trained on historical data predicts the best-suited crop for current conditions.

### Features

* Live prediction based on current environmental conditions
* Integrates IoT with ML for smart agriculture
* High accuracy using ensemble learning (Random Forest)
* Modular and extendable for future improvements

### Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Scikit-learn** (Random Forest Classifier)
* **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)
* **ESP 32** (Sensor integration)
